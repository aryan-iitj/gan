Code accompanying our [Dist-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08887) and [GN-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01333) (update soon) papers.

## Setup

### Dependencies
Python 2.7 or 3.x, Numpy, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras (1D demo) <br>
For Python 3.x - `import pickle` in the file `distgan_image/modules/dataset.py`

### Getting Started
We conduct experiments of our model with 1D/2D synthetic data, MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets.

#### 1D demo
In addition to Dist-GAN, other methods, such as GAN, MDGAN, VAEGAN, WGAN-GP are provided in our 1D code.

```
>> cd distgan_toy1d
>> python gan_toy1d.py
```

Quick video demos, you can reproduce easily these videos with our code:

[WGANGP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MDBwdfD5rY) (WGAN-GP can match data distribution at some time, but diverged later) <br>
[VAEGAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=587z8VBcvvQ) <br>
[Dist-GAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjbdMNo4m_8) <br>

The visualization part of our 1D code is re-used from [here](https://github.com/kremerj/gan):

#### 2D synthetic data
```
>> cd distgan_toy2d
>> python distgan_toy2d.py
```

We provide three different data layouts you can test on: 'SINE' 'PLUS' 'SQUARE'. Just change the parameter `testcase` in the code `gaan_toy2d.py`. For example:
```
testcase      = 'SQUARE'
```

#### Image data (MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10)

We provide our code for image datasets, such as: MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10.

##### MNIST

```
>> cd distgan_image
>> python distgan_mnist.py
```

```
>> cd distgan_image
>> python distgan_celeba.py

##### STL-10
Downloading STL-10 from: http://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/stl10_binary.tar.gz and extract it into a folder. Then, using `./modules/create_stl10.py` to read binary file `unlabeled_X.bin` and save images into a specific folder: eg. `./data/stl-10/`

```
>> cd distgan_image
>> python distgan_stl10.py
```

## Results

FID scores of Dist-GAN for CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets are summarized, following experiment setup of [2] with standard CNN architecture (FID is computed with 10K real images and 5K generated images). Dist-GAN is trained with 300K iterations.
